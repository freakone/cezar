 * Agent isolation — running a task's agent inside a container instead of on the

 * questions with different answers:
 *
 *  - CAN this machine isolate? (is a container runtime installed, is its VM up)
 *  - SHOULD this project isolate? (the operator's setting)
 *
 * Collapsing them into one boolean is what makes an isolation toggle
 * unexplainable: "off" would mean both "you turned it off" and "your VM is
 * stopped", which need different words and different fixes. So the status
 * carries a human-readable `reason` and, where one exists, the single `fix`
 * command that resolves it.
