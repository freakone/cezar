/**
 * Which of the operator's credentials an isolated agent may use.
 *
 * Isolation without any credentials is useless — an agent that cannot reach
 * GitHub or a cloud project cannot do the work. Isolation with ALL of them is
 * pointless — the container would hold everything the host does. So this is the
 * dial in between, and it is per credential, on purpose.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because they protect different things:
 *
 *  - **mount** — the container reads the live file. Refreshed tokens keep
 *    working, which is required for anything the tool rewrites (a cloud CLI
 *    refreshing an OAuth token). The cost is that the container can also WRITE
 *    it, and revoking means revoking for the host too.
 *  - **copy** — the container gets a snapshot at start. Nothing it does reaches
 *    the host's file, and the copy dies with the container. The cost is that a
 *    refresh inside does not persist, and a credential rotated on the host is
 *    stale in a long-running container.
 *
 * Mount is right for things that refresh, copy for static keys. Neither is
 * right for everything, which is why the choice is exposed rather than decided.
 *
 * One rule constrains the catalog, learned the hard way: **never file-mount
 * something its owner rewrites atomically.** A bind mount binds an inode, and a
 * temp-file-plus-rename unlinks it — the container is left holding a deleted
 * file, reads fail with ENOENT, and the tool reports itself logged out. Mount
 * the containing DIRECTORY (stable inode) or copy the file; both survive.
